Things to add/change to @nortex/handler:
- Usage should be concatonated with the prefix + command [✔]
- Don't reject promise when no command part is present [+docs] [✔]
- All additional command ...options should be available in `this.x` [✔]
- Set cooldown function which sets per-execution cooldown [✔]
- Make interaction handling not automatic and instead require runInteraction() method like classic [✔]
- Add an @override flag on run() functions [✔]
- Set prefix method (even though assigning manually works) [✔]

- Make sure promise resolves synchronously (dont wait for actual execution) [✔]

- Refactor: Interaction refreshing [✔]
- Fix: events innherited from filenames are toLowerCase'd() which makes events like messageCreate messagecreate [✔]

- Add a runXunsafely() variant to run without any checks
- Add getCommands(), getInteractions() etc. for querying elements

- Change commands and interactions Map to a custom Collection
- Combined handler which has `async runCommand` and `async runInteraction`
- Fetchers utility with sharding support
