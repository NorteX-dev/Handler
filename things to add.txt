Things to add/change to @nortex/handler:
- Consolidate ComponentHandler and CommandsHandler
- Add a toUpperCase() on option types when registering
- Create a custom "passthrough" to interactionCreate which creates a temporary Map<InteractionID, JSONData> and allows to fetch using getJSONData(interactionId)
-   Make a modified MessageButton() extender which will store the data automatically
- Combined handler which has `async runCommand` and `async runInteraction`
- Make most exports default
- Fetchers utility with sharding support
- Custom runtime error validators
- Built-in subcommand support for subcommands in commands (maybe as Util) (?)

// Abandoned:
- Change commands and interactions Map to a custom Collection [✔ Idea abandoned in favor of an array of objects]
- Add getCommands(), getInteractions() etc. for querying elements [✔ Idea abandoned in favor of using this.commands]
- Add a runXunsafely() variant to run without any checks [✔ Idea abandoned in favor of using `handler.commands.find(r => r.name === "command name").run()` manually]
- Add "ws" support for events [✔ Idea abandoned in favor of using "raw"]
